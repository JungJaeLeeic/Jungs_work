For the Linear Regression, there is a bug that if you look at either
residual plot or cook's distance and you click the 'SEE THE REGRESSION' button followed by
'SEE THE PLOT' button, the plot crashes. I think it is to do with the width setting of the plot.

There is the same issue with the Simpson's Paradox, when you look at the challenge tab
and you click either 'INDIVIDUAL CORRELATION' or 'OVERALL CORRELATION', followed by
'SEE THE PLOT' button, the plot crashes again.


Both of the visualisations have problems with the iframe. the plot width becomes really large
and the guidance won't work inside the frame.
